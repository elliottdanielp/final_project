Titanic Passenger Survival...

Did the survival rate of the Titanic have anything to do with what class the passenger was in? Or was it the passengers age or maybe their sex that played a role in the survival rate? What if them having sibilings or a spouse on board played a role?

The reason the grop chose this question to answer is in Aprill of 2012 the Titanic II was anounced. The intended launch date was originally set to be 2016 but delayed to 2018 and push again untill 2022. The project was resumed in november 2018 after a hiatus which began in 2015 cause by a financial dispute. 

With the help of Kagle the team was able to aquire multiple data sets, with information ranging from Passanger name's, sex, age all the way to if they had parents, sibilings or a spouse on board. The data sets also include where the passanger embarked from with 3 options for the passangers - Southampton, Cherbourg and Queenstown. 

Will the Titanic II ever set sail? Who knows, but if it does will the passangers face the same fate as the original?
