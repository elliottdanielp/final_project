Titanic Passenger Survival...

Did the survival rate of the Titanic have anything to do with what class the passenger was in? Or was it the passengers age or maybe their sex that played a role in the survival rate? What if them having siblings or a spouse on board played a role?

The reason the group chose this question to answer is in April of 2012 the Titanic II was announced. The intended launch date was originally set to be 2016 but delayed to 2018 and push again until 2022. The project was resumed in November 2018 after a hiatus which began in 2015 cause by a financial dispute.

With the help of Kaggle the team was able to acquire multiple data sets, with information ranging from Passenger name's, sex, age all the way to if they had parents, siblings or a spouse on board. The data sets also include where the passenger embarked from with 3 options for the passengers - Southampton, Cherbourg and Queenstown.
Will the Titanic II ever set sail? Who knows, but if it does will the passengers face the same fate as the original?
